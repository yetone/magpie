// magpie's plugin host: runs OpenCode (v1) server plugins under Bun and
// answers magpie over stdin/stdout, one JSON message a line.
//
// magpie → host: {id, method, params}; the host answers {id, result} or
// {id, error}. A fetch streams its reply first: {id, event: "head", status,
// headers}, then {id, event: "chunk", data} (base64) as the body comes, then
// {id, result: null}. {method: "abort", params: {id}} cancels one, and
// {method: "credit", params: {id, n}} gives a fetch back the n charged bytes
// its reader took (the payload it read, and a frame's overhead once the frame
// is done), so it may send that much more. A fetch starts with the window
// magpie gave it and sends no more than that ahead of its reader, so a slow
// reader pauses its upstream instead of the host buffering without bound.
// host → magpie, unasked: {event: "log", level, message} and {event:
// "toast", ...} (what a plugin logs or shows), {event: "auth", provider}
// (a sign-in the host saved or refreshed).
//
// The plugins get what OpenCode hands them (PluginInput): a client whose
// auth.set saves to magpie's plugin-auth.json in OpenCode's auth.json shape,
// tui.showToast and app.log, config.get; Bun's $; the folder magpie keeps
// its files in. What else a plugin asks the client for answers {data:
// undefined}.
//
// A provider may be signed in to more than once: the first account is kept
// under the provider's id, as OpenCode keeps it, the others under
// id#<slot>. Everything a request does runs in its account's scope, so the
// plugin's getAuth, client.auth.set and loader see that account alone.
