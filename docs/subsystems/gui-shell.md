# GUI app shell

The desktop app has a tray (menu bar) icon whose click drops a compact
panel, and a regular window. Both show one small web UI served from
embedded assets. The page talks to Go over a JSON API on the same handler,
with no binding generator and no bundler. `magpie web` serves the same page
to a browser for a machine with no desktop. Package `internal/gui` hosts all
three.

## Responsibilities and sources of truth

| Part | Responsibility | Source |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Native host | `Run` starts the Wails v3 app: the tray icon, the panel, the main window, single-instance handover, `magpie://` import links and open at login. `host` implements `Windows` for the API: show and hide, open URLs and folders, copy to the clipboard, fit and tint the panel, and set the text size. | [`app.go`](../../internal/gui/app.go), [`mainwindow.go`](../../internal/gui/mainwindow.go), [`traymenu.go`](../../internal/gui/traymenu.go) |
| Backend | `startBackend` starts the gateway this process serves, unless another magpie already serves it. In that case this process only shows the other one's status (`gw` is nil). `stopServing` drains requests in flight. | [`backend.go`](../../internal/gui/backend.go) |
| API and assets | `Handler` serves `assets/` (embedded with `//go:embed assets`) and the `/api/*` routes, such as `/api/state`, `/api/set` and `/api/agents/{action}/{id}`. `held` lets one API request's reads share one catalog build (`provider.Hold`), and drops it after any write. `revalidated` and `versionedPage` name each script by its content hash, so a cache never serves an old `app.js` under a new page. | [`api.go`](../../internal/gui/api.go) |
| Browser mode | `StartWeb` serves the page and the gateway for `magpie web`. The browser signs in with a run key in a link. Gateway mode shows only Providers, Gateway, Routing, Usage, Plugins and Settings on a machine that is only a gateway. | [`web.go`](../../internal/gui/web.go), [`gatewaymode.go`](../../internal/gui/gatewaymode.go) |
| The page | `app.js` keeps one state object per view and renders it into a list, with no framework. The views have their own files: `routing.js`, `library.js`, `plugins.js` and `sessions.js`. Strings go through `t()` with translations in `i18n.js` (zh, ja and de; the English text is the key and the fallback). Dropdowns use `openProtoMenu`. Scrolling is done only by `scrollOnPurpose(e)` with the reader's event. | [`assets/app.js`](../../internal/gui/assets/app.js), [`assets/i18n.js`](../../internal/gui/assets/i18n.js) |
| No GUI build | `-tags nogui` builds magpie without the GUI: `hasGUI` is false and `runGUI` says to use `magpie tui`. The files of `internal/gui` that need Wails build under `!nogui`. | [`gui_off.go`](../../gui_off.go) |

## Runtime path

1. `magpie` with no arguments, `magpie app` or `magpie tray` calls `runGUI`, which calls `gui.Run`. A `nogui` build runs the TUI instead. A second launch hands over to the instance already running.
2. `startBackend` brings up the gateway, or finds another magpie serving it.
3. The panel and the window load `index.html` from `Handler`. `boot.js` passes the saved language, theme and text size before the first paint.
4. The page reads `GET /api/state` and writes through `POST` routes. Each write answers with the new state, built under `held`.
5. Closing the window hides it. On the Mac a full-screen window first leaves full screen (`closeStep`).
6. The window opens as it was last left. Its settled size and whether it was maximised are kept in `settings.Window` and `settings.WindowMaximised` (`settle`; per machine, see `KeepOwn`). A maximised window keeps the size it restores to. `makeMain` opens it at that size (`openSize`). On its first show, `placeMain` maximises it again on the Mac and Windows (on Windows once the page has come). On Linux, `makeMain` makes it maximised with `StartState`. On Windows a size larger than the screen's work area is fitted and centred (`fitRoom`), and the larger size stays kept. The window's position is not kept.

## Constraints and failure behavior

- Every user-visible string has zh, ja and de translations with the same placeholders. `gui-ja.test.cjs` and `gui-de.test.cjs` fail on a missing one.
- A click never moves the page. Code scrolls a view only with the reader's event in hand (`scrollOnPurpose`); `click-scroll.test.cjs` guards this.
- There are no native `<select>` elements and no colored left-border stripes. State is shown with a dot or a swatch.
- The page must work in Chromium (Windows' WebView2) and WebKit (macOS, and WebKitGTK on Linux). GUI tests run in both engines.
- Tests never touch a live agent config. The package's `TestMain` runs under `testenv`'s home of its own. Playwright tests serve `assets/` with isolated `/api` fixtures.
- `POST /api/settings/codex-auto-review` accepts an empty value (Codex's own choice) or an exact model/group ID in `provider.Served`, including unlisted providers. A known provider with an unknown or empty model name is rejected without changing the saved reviewer or catalog tag. Generic gateway request resolution remains permissive; it is not the validator for this setting. See `Handler` in [`api.go`](../../internal/gui/api.go) and `TestCodexAutoReviewSetting` in [`codex_auto_review_test.go`](../../internal/gui/codex_auto_review_test.go).

`openModal` makes the background inert when an editor opens fresh, leaving
confirmations and menus interactive through redraws. `closeModal` releases
that background as soon as the close animation starts, so clicks reach the
page while the editor fades away. Opening an editor during that animation
protects the background again. `ux-safety.test.cjs` checks these transitions.
Routing's New group buttons share `newGroup`, which asks before replacing a
dirty group draft; Cancel retains the draft and Discard opens the new editor.
`newGroupWith` applies the same guard when creating a group from a model and
waits for `show` to accept navigation before creating its draft.

## Verification

```sh
go test -tags nogui ./internal/gui
make test-ui                      # every internal/gui/tests/*.test.cjs, Chromium and WebKit
BROWSER=webkit node --test internal/gui/tests/click-scroll.test.cjs
```

`make test-ui` needs Node.js and Playwright (`playwright install chromium
webkit`). Set `NODE_PATH` when Playwright is installed outside the repo. The
Test workflow in CI does not run this suite, so a GUI change must run it
locally and report the result. See [`tests/README.md`](../../internal/gui/tests/README.md).
