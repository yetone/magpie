# Sync and backup

`internal/backup` collects magpie's portable setup into a passphrase-sealed
bundle. `internal/davsync` keeps that bundle in a WebDAV folder, an S3 bucket
or a GitHub repository. It merges changes between computers; it does not
clone a working tree or synchronize arbitrary files.

## Sources of truth

- [`Config`, `Configure`, `Status` and `syncOnce`](../../internal/davsync/davsync.go)
  keep the active server in `sync.json`, and the last local/remote hashes,
  versions, notices and undo file in `sync-state.json`. These files live beside
  magpie's settings. Secrets are local, never in the status response.
- The [`remote`](../../internal/davsync/dav.go) interface reads a version and
  conditionally replaces it. WebDAV and S3 use ETags; GitHub uses the blob SHA
  required by its Contents API. [`github.go`](../../internal/davsync/github.go)
  interprets `github://owner/repo[/prefix]`, with `Config.Branch` selecting a
  branch or using the repository's default.
- [`backup.go`](../../internal/backup/backup.go) owns bundle contents and
  sealing. Sync divides the setup into providers, settings, profiles, agents
  and library. Provider keys, agent models, library and usage have their own
  inclusion switches.
- [`usage.go`](../../internal/davsync/usage.go) shares separately sealed usage
  and quota files through a remote's `files` interface.
- [`restore.go`](../../internal/davsync/restore.go) replaces local parts from
  the remote bundle, first keeping the local setup for Undo.
- [`backup.go`](../../internal/gui/backup.go), the Settings form in
  [`app.js`](../../internal/gui/assets/app.js) and
  [`webdav_cli.go`](../../webdav_cli.go) reach the same sync operations.

## Runtime and state

The gateway runs sync every three minutes by default. `SetAuto` can select a
longer interval or manual sync only. Saving in Settings syncs immediately.
Each operation holds the sync lock, so configuration changes cannot race a
sync's state write.

A first computer creates a remote backup. Another computer joining takes
the remote setup and keeps displaced local parts in its sync folder.
Subsequent syncs compare each part with the hashes from the previous sync:
local-only changes go up, remote-only changes come down, and a part changed
on both sides keeps the newer version while retaining the replaced copy.
A conditional write refused because another computer committed in between
is retried through this same merge.

When a remote file is empty, damaged or another app's format, sync stops and
describes it through `ServerFile`. Settings and the backend's `upload` command
can replace it with this computer's setup, keeping the old file first.
HTML and XML are not offered for replacement. GitHub diagnostics name the
repository and `magpie github upload`, rather than WebDAV's recovery path.

Switching services keeps all inactive kinds in `Config.Servers`. `Other`
remains the most recently left server for compatibility with older saved
configurations and clients. Only the active server is used. Empty credential
fields reuse a saved credential only for its matching account; GitHub
restricts reuse to the same owner/repo. Branch or prefix changes within that
repository can keep the token. The branch is part of the sync state key.

## GitHub constraints and errors

- The repository must exist. In an empty repository, the first encrypted
  backup initializes its default branch through the Contents API. A selected
  branch other than the default must already exist. The token needs repository
  Contents read and write.
- Backups are `<prefix>/magpie/magpie.magpie-backup`; optional usage files
  live beside them under `usage/`. Changes create commits, and unchanged
  setup does not create another backup commit.
- Tokens are separate from the library's GitHub token, sent only to
  `https://api.github.com`, and must differ from the encryption passphrase.
  Repository history retains older encrypted versions.
- Repository and branch access is checked before a file's 404 can mean
  "no backup yet." Failed reads and malformed metadata fail sync.
- Only the ref endpoint's explicit `409: Git Repository is empty.` allows
  initialization, after repository access and the default branch are checked.
  The initial write omits `branch` so GitHub creates its default branch; other
  conflicts and missing branches are not treated as an empty repository.
- Large files are downloaded by blob SHA, preserving the version that was
  read. Sync files are limited to 64 MiB. Usage listing fails at the Contents
  API's 1,000-file limit rather than treating a truncated list as complete.
- A stale SHA or a racing initial creation returns `errChanged`. Other 422
  responses stay actionable errors. Authentication, permission and branch
  failures remain distinct from missing files. Rate limits use sync backoff.
- Request archival remains an S3-only feature; its objects are separate from
  the encrypted setup and usage files.

## Verification

```sh
go test -tags nogui ./internal/davsync
go test -tags nogui . -run 'TestGitHubCmd|TestWebdavCmd|TestS3Cmd'
node --test internal/gui/tests/github-sync.test.cjs internal/gui/tests/s3-sync.test.cjs internal/gui/tests/sync-other-kind.test.cjs
```

`TestGitHubEmptyRepository` covers the first encrypted backup initializing an
empty repository and an unchanged second sync. `TestGitHubEmptyRepositoryFailures`
covers missing branches, unrelated ref conflicts and another computer winning
the initial write. `TestGitHubNotBackup` covers backend-specific recovery
advice when the repository holds an empty or foreign file.

Go tests use `testenv` homes and HTTP fixtures. Browser tests use isolated
API fixtures in Chromium and WebKit. A live GitHub write requires a test
repository and token; fixture tests do not establish that a particular
account's permissions or repository rules allow commits.
